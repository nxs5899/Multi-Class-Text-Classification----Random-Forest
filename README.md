# Multi-Class-Text-Classification----Random-Forest

when the size of a software project becomes large, managing the workflow and the development process is more challenging. therefore, it is essential for the management team and lead developers to understand the type of work that is carried out by the software developers.

this machine learning program is designed to classify multi-class categories of the commit messages. it can be used on different textual datasets. the size of the dataset: this program was tested on about 3500 commit messages with 5 different labels. the classifier was evaluated by the claculated precision of 0.96, and recall of 0.94.
